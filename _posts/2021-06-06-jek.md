### Welcome to Jek

Thanks for checking out Jek! I am very excited to bring this concept into a reality. For years I've been using Jekyll themes and wishing for better options when setting and creating theme styles. Many jekyll themes either only come with a light/dark mode, or have complicated css/sass styling that make it difficult to change or create new themes easily. Jek is my solution for simple to use, easy to develop color schemes for Jekyll.
